portfolio-november-2014
=======================

Personal portfolio site.

<a href="http://miri.codes">miri.codes</a>

The site is up, and (AFAIK) bug-free, but incomplete.

Upcoming features:
-scripted visual 'reflection' of the header text on the right side of the header
-nicer, fancier solution for showing portfolio mocks than the "literally just here is the file" solution
-animations on hover for the portfolio items
	- e.g. hover over 'how much sunlight', + will turn into moon (as on howmuchsunlight.com)
